# Simple Node.js CRUD API

## Description

This is simple Node.js CRUD app.

## Technical requirements

- `nodemon`, `dotenv`, `cross-env`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, `eslint`,`webpack-cli`, `webpack`, `jest`.
- Use 18 LTS version of Node.js

## Implementation details

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
   - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
   - **GET** `api/users/${userId}`
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and and record with `id === userId` if it exists
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
   - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
     - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
     - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **DELETE** `api/users/${userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
2. Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:
   - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side
   - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)
   - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
   - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. `some-non/existing/resource`) should be handled (server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding human-friendly message)
4. Errors on the server side that occur during the processing of a request should be handled and processed correctly (server should answer with `status code` **500** and corresponding human-friendly message)
5. Value of `port` on which application is running stored in `.env` file
6. There should be 2 modes of running application (**development** and **production**):
   - The application is run in development mode using `nodemon` (there is a `npm` script `start:dev`)
   - The application is run in production mode (there is a `npm` script `start:prod` that starts the build process and then runs the bundled file)
7. There could be implemented horizontal scaling for application (there is a `npm` script `start:multi` that starts multiple instances of your application using the Node.js `Cluster` API (equal to the number of logical processor cores on the host machine, each listening on port PORT + n) with a **load balancer** that distributes requests across them (using Round-robin algorithm). For example: host machine has 4 cores, `PORT` is 4000. On run `npm run start:multi` it works following way
